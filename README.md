MVC4 Bootstrap
=============

ASP. Net MVC4 base solution with Twitter Bootstrap theme applied.

I've created this solution to avoid having to mess around with removing the bloat that MVC provides you when you start a new project.  I've also applied basic Twitter Bootstrap responsive theming to allow you to get a project up and running quickly.
    
You should be able to load the solution in Visual Studio 2012 and just run it out of the box.
